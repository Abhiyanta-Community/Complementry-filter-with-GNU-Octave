# Overview
For estimating the position or orientation of a robot we can not rely on only one sensor as every sensor is having some drawbacks. For better accuracy of data we generally extract data for the same physical quantity from more than one sensor. As an example to calculate the orientation of robots we can use IMU sensors like accelerometers and Gyroscope. Both of them have some advantages and disadvantages. To overcome its individual inaccuracy we try to estimate an accurate angle using data of both the sensors. In this task, you will be learning a Complementary filter algorithm to fuse data from the accelerometer and Gyroscope. As the task is to learn algorithms here 1000 samples of data have already been provided in the form of an excel file and you need to import that file in GNU Octave software to implement the task.

# Take Care:
In order to run the codes "signal" and "i/o" packages must be priorly installed in the octave. 

# Task Document
